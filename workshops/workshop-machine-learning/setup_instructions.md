No setup is required since we're hosting the notebook online - either clone the repo or just click the link in the .ipynb file to open up Google Colaboratory online:
http://colab.research.google.com/

Make sure you're logged into a Google account to use Colaboratory!

Alternatively, you could run the notebook locally, however you will have to install Jupyter Notebooks and the relevant libraries imported in the notebook (e.g. keras).
